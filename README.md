# Special thanks

This app is made based on the guidance and reference from the **[Lama Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@LamaDev/featured)** tutorial.

This app may not be able to proceed if it does not follow the procedure, although many things are lacking from the video but from a little study of this tutorial, I can make an application with my first Firebase without a hitch.
